***`Abstract:`***

`This report was written to create a model capable of predicting whether a traveler survived or not `

`In the model: Gender, Age & Pclass will be included and we will use Machine Learning Method (Linear regression) `

## I. Introduction
- Incident can happen anytime in any era. While it takes away money, asset and human life sometimes it still can spare some survivors. 

- When looking at the data about some incidents, we question ourselves, are survivors predictable? 

- In this report, we will visualize some data in the given file, to give a clearer picture about the answer to the question above

-Beside, we will have a bonus part which include a heat map and a simple regression model to predict with the given input, whether an individual will survive or not.

## II. Data processing

### 2.1. Source of data

We will use the provided data which comes from Kaggle. 

Kaggle gives us two excel files which include file for training and for testing model. But as the testing is provided for testing the model and not included the the data about whether the people in there survived or not, we decide to just using the the train.csv file.

The data is about the Titanic incident which happened in 4/1911. From 2204 individuals on that ship, there was only 1502 people suvived after the accident.

Eventhough there was 2204 individuals on the ship, the file we receive only contain data of 890 people.

### 2.2. Data dictionary

The table was provided by Kaggle.

Note: In the progress, we will change variable in Sex column into **1 (male) / 0 (female)** to make the caculation and coding easier


## III. Chart analysing

3.1. Pie chart
This chart was made to compare the percentage of female and male in the survivor.

It can be tell from the chart that if someone is a female, she will have chance to survive in the Titanic incident. While the chart did not indicate that if you are a male, the percentage that you will live is 20.3%, it highlight the significant difference in the percent of female to male in the survival data.

3.2. Bar chart

## III. Result

After training our model, we come up with a equation like below:
![](images/coefficientvisualization1.png)
**` ≈∑= 0.40 + -0.16 * Pclass + -0.07 * Age + -0.22 * Sex `**

- This equation indicates that the decrease in Pclass & the increase in Age will lead to the decrease in the total resule. If the gender is male(which is one in the model) will also decrease the survivor chance.

- But is this model reliable? If we look at OLS Regression Result, we can see that **all of the P-value is really small**, which is a good sign as every variables that we use are significant. 

But when we look at the R square: **0.37** - not a really good & strong relationship but in fact, it is actually a moderate relationship.

So, should we keep trusting the model? Even though the R square is not significant enough, I think the model that we create is still acceptable.

Beside, when we use score funcition to evaluate the R square, it gives us **0.46** which is a better result.

## IV. Discussion

When analyzing this model, it tells us something about the attribute that makes we survive:

- First: **Gender & Age** - it is actually commonsense. In every incidents, woman, the young and the old is always priority. They are the group which are more likely to receive a lifeboat than the male and adult. It may also explain why the Age value in the model has the coefficent at only **0.07** as not only the young being priority but also the old.


- Second: **PClass** - it highly recommends that if you book the higher class in a voyage, it is more likely that you will survived. Perhaps, it happens as the higher class in a voyager is equipped with more emergency equipment that the individuals from lower class have more chance to access rescue transportation than the other people in different classes.

## V. Conclusion

- In the last, we want to disclaim that, there will be other models which have the capability to explain the data better than the model we use, but the linear model that we use can easily understand and analyze for most of people. 

- Another thing we want to discuss is that this incident is quite "specific", as there are many kinds of transportation accidents, plus Titanic happened along time ago so it might be a little out of date with the technology, mindset and culture today. 

But we highly believe that the attribute we chose which is sex, age and pclass in any era still have a big impact in the survival rate of a passenger.
